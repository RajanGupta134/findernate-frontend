PLACEHOLDER FILE - Replace with actual ringtone.mp3

To add ringtones to your application:

1. Download or create a ringtone audio file (MP3 format recommended)
2. Keep it short (3-10 seconds) as it will loop
3. Replace this file with your ringtone.mp3
4. Make sure the filename is exactly 'ringtone.mp3'

Free ringtone sources:
- https://www.freesound.org/ (search for "phone ring" or "ringtone")
- https://www.zedge.net/ringtones
- Create your own using Audacity or similar audio software

If no audio file is provided, the application will fall back to browser-generated beep sounds.
